      All About Dams.
      <br />
      This is a website for a school project by Demyan, Diego, and me.
      <br />
      This is the first time I've made a complete website.
      <br />
      This is also the first time Demyan and Diego have made a complete
      animation in Scratch.
      <br />
      We can say,
      <br />
      we are all very proud of what we have done.
      <br />
      So please enjoy the website!
